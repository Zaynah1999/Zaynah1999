# Hi I'm Zaynah and welcome to my profile 👩🏽‍💻
I am currently a full stack developer specialising in .NET, C#, SQL and Javascript. Before my current role I worked with Python and AWS where I developed my passion for backend engineering. In my spare time I am currently working on full stack project whilst also expanding my Typescript knowledge. I am also open to collaborations so feel free to connect.
